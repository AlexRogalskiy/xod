However, many tools are involved and the initial XOD IDE installation can lack some of them. When you upload to a new kind of a board for the first time, a message will appear asking to Download & Install required tools. Confirm to setup them automatically. Keep in mind, it can consume 200 MB or so of Internet traffic and take up a few minutes.\n\n## Exercise\n\nLet's upload this patch to the Arduino board to see the built-in LED blinking.\n\n1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer with a USB cable.\n2. Upload the program. To do this, hit Deploy ‚Üí Upload to Arduino from the main menu.\n3. If some tools are missing, confirm the installation by clicking Download & Install in the message appeared.\n\nSee the on-board LED usually marked with the `L` letter blinking.\n\nChange the `IVAL` value on the `clock` node and upload the program again. See how the blinking frequency of the LED changes.",
