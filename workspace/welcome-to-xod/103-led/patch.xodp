The false value auto-converts to 0 and represents no glow at all, whereas the true value converts to 1 and denotes the full brightness.\n\nYou can also set an intermediate brightness level by setting values *between* 0 and 1.\n\n## Exercise\n\nLetâ€™s fine-tune LED brightness.\n\n1. Assemble a circuit according to the [scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/103-led/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit), and connect the board to your computer.\n\n2. Set the value of the `PORT` pin to `D11`. Leading \"D\" means that it's a digital port.\n\n3. Replace the `tweak-boolean` node with `tweak-number`.\n\n4. Upload the program with the interactive session enabled.\n\n5. Change the value of `tweak-number` in the range from 0 to 1 and see how the brightness of the LED changes.",
