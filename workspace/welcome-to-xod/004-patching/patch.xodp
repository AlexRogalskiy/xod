Once you spot it there, drag‚Äôn‚Äôdrop the item to the patch board or hit Place in its context menu.",

Double-click on some empty space on the patch; the suggester line will appear.\n2. Start typing ‚Äúclock‚Äù into it and press Enter once you see `xod/core/clock`.\n3. A new `clock` node will appear where you have double-clicked.\n4. Move the node around by dragging it.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 to add `count` and `watch` nodes.\n6. Create a link between `clock`'s `TICK` pin and `count`'s `INC` pin by clicking on one pin, then the other.\n7. Create a link between `count`'s output pin and `watch`'s input pin.\n\nRun the simulation to see how the counters work in parallel. Try to set different `IVAL` parameters and see how it changes the behavior.",
