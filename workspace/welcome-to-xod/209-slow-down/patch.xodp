These nodes evaluate themselves on each transaction.\n\nSometimes it's excessive and may lead to slowing the program performance. Especially if you're working with sensors that depend on timing like an ultrasonic range meter.\n\nTo avoid this, you can replace the \"Continuously\" with another source that pulses with the desired interval or only when necessary. For example, a `clock` node.\n\n## Exercise\n\nMake the temperature display less sporadic.\n\n1. Place a `clock` node.\n2. Link it with the `UPD` pin of the `thermometer-tmp36` node.\n3. Upload the program.\n\nHeat and cool down the thermometer and observe the incremental changes of the data shown.",
