      "content": "# Getting Help\n\nBy now you should be a bit bored by the `clock` and `counter`. XOD offers many more nodes to work with and yet more [nodes are shared by the community](https://xod.io/libs/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial) members. What a node does is described with a short annotation carried with the node. Your discovery starts with reading these descriptions.\n\n## Exercise\n\nLet's learn a few ways to see nodesâ€™ descriptions.\n\n1. Scroll to the `xod/math` section in the Project Browser and click to expand it.\n2. Click on the `clip` patch, and then press the H key. A help box with the description will appear.\n3. Click on another patch. Help panel will move and show a description for it.\n4. Select some node on the patch board and press the H key. Quick Help panel will appear at the right side of the patch board.\n\nDiscover a few more nodes bundled within the XOD standard library.",
