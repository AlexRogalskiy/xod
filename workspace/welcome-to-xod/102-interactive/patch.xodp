Upload the program with the interactive session enabled: hit Deploy ‚Üí Upload to Arduino and check \"Debug after upload\".\n\n3. Once the interactive session has been started, select `tweak-boolean` and change its value; see how the built-in LED on the board reacts to these changes.\n\nTo stop the interactive session press \"Stop\" button on the green panel above. To start the interactive session again, you have to re-upload the program.",
