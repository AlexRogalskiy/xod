The browser version does not have enough permissions to access USB ports. Nevertheless, you can upload XOD programs even from the browser version if you have the original Arduino IDE installed by copying and pasting the generated code.\n\nIf you have no hardware on hand, donâ€™t give up. Skip to the `200-patterns` part and go on replacing hardware nodes with `watch`es and `tweak`s.",
