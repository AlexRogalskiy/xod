Please, use XOD [forum](https://forum.xod.io) to discuss a feature prior to creating it here. Features come from the [Roadmap](https://github.com/xodio/xod/wiki/Roadmap) and community brainstorms. GitHub issues are things to be scheduled, tracked, and implemented, they are _not_ a place for discussions.

### Rationale

What we have now, what we want then? How the implementation would make the product better for end-users?

### Prerequisites

Refer to issues by their #numbers that should be completed before the development of this issue would make sense

### User story

Describe the most straightforward usage scenario

- [ ] I open this
- [ ] I create that
- [ ] I click there
- [ ] I benefit from the result in a such way

### Acceptance criteria

Provide some steps that an end-user would be able to perform when the feature could be considered as implemented. E.g.:

- [ ] The basic scenario works as described
- [ ] If I do not enter a value, an error¹ is shown
- [ ] Clicking OK changes all nodes’ labels to the Foo value

¹
```markdown
**Value not specified**
You should specify the bar value to make foo happy.
Use Inspector to enter a qux of your choice.
```

### Out of scope

Explicitly list functionality that is not intended to be done with this story.

### How to implement

If you have an idea on how to implement it, provide a short description.

### How to test

How can we test what’s implemented?
