### Environment

* Scope: desktop IDE, browser IDE, CLI
* Version: 0.xx.x | dev <!-- Hit “Help” in the IDE main menu to view -->
* OS: Windows 10 | macOS High Sierra (10.13) | Ubuntu 18.04
* Machine: i3, 4 GB RAM

### Steps to reproduce

Try to narrow down your scenario to a minimal working/failing example. That is, if you have a big program causing a problem, start with deleting parts not relevant to the issue and observing the result: is the problem still there? Repeat until you get the most straightforward sequence of steps to reproduce the problem without any noise surrounding it.

1.  Open this
2.  Press that
3.  Click here and there

Attach the test program `.xodball` if it is not trivial to replicate. You’ll have to zip the file as GitHub does not accept file attachments with custom extensions.

### Expected behavior

What should happen?

### Actual behavior

What’s happen now?

Attach screenshots or GIF’s of what’s going on if it makes the issue more illustrative

### Console output <!-- if any -->

Are there any errors in the console? Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the developer tools and find the “Console” tab there. Error are shown in red. Expand an error, then copy and paste the output verbatim. Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) to preserve formatting.

### How to fix <!-- if you know -->

If you have an idea on how the bug can be fixed, provide a short description.
